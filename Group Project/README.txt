I have a video demoing this project that you can watch on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5I4kgzRqk&ab_channel=Ryan_Cola).
This is a website that I created with a group in my Software Engineering course at WPI. It was a remaster of the website Kickstarter with our own spin on it. You can still locally host the website through npm start, but the actual AWS website that we hosted it on through S3 was taken down to avoid getting billed after the course was completed. Note that if you try to locally host the website, most of the website will not be functional, as all of the lambda functions were taken down. You can still see our lambda functions in Punchstarter -> lambdafunctions/punchstarterapp .
